# Financial-Fraud-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-

Developed an AI-based system to detect Financial fraud in real-time, leveraging deep learning models like Transformers, CNNs, and GANs for fraud identification and simulation of forged transactions. Use EfficientNet for image-based fraud detection, whileintegrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model transparency and ensure ethical decision-making. Visualize fraud pa erns and risks using Tableau or Seaborn, aiding stakeholders in making informed,data-driven investment decisions. Achieved 95% accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions, reducing false
 positives.
